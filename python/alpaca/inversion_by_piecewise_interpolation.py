def find_indices_of_extrema(y):
    """Find the positions of local extrema in a list of numbers

    In a list with :math:`N` entries, a local minimum is defined by

    ..math:: x_{i-1} > x_i < x_{i+1}

    ..math:: 0 < i < N-1.

    The corner points :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_{N-1}` do not count as local extrema.
    The condition for a local maximum is:

    ..math:: x_{i-1} < x_i > x_{i+1}.

    Whenever one of the two sets of inequalities is fulfilled, this function will report the
    index :math:`i`.
    In the special case that

    ..math:: x_i = x_{i+1},

    this function will test the inequality

    ..math:: x_{i-1} > x_i < x_{j}

    for all

    ..math:: i+1 < j < N-1

    instead, until an element of the list is encountered that is different from :math:`x_i`.
    In other words, equal elements in the list are skipped in the search for extrema.
    Note that if

    ..math:: x_i = x_{N-1}

    for

    ..math:: i < N-1,

    then there is no extremum with an index larger or equal to :math:`i`.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    y: list of int or float
        (One-dimensional) List of numbers.

    Returns:
    --------
    list of int
        List of indices of local extrema.

    This function inverts a one-dimensional function :math:`y = f(x)` by creating a piecewise
    interpolation :math:`\tilde{f}^{-1}` of the true inverse :math:`x = f^{-1}(y)`.
    The inverse is created from pairs of values :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_i` for
    :math:`0 < i < N-1` after finding the local extrema in the list of :math:`y` values which
    make the inverse ambiguous.
    Between every two local extrema, `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` is used to create a continuous
    mapping from :math:`y` to :math:`x` values.
    The result is return as a `PiecewiseInterpolation` object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y: (N,1) ndarray of float or list of float
        Values of :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_i`. Both lists must have the same length.
    kind: string
        Type of interpolation. Equivalent to `scipy.interpolate.interp1d`'s `kind` option.
        In fact, this option is simply passed on the the `scipy` interpolator.

    Returns
    -------
    PiecewiseInterpolation
        Piecewise-interpolate approximation of the inverse of :math:`f`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        After determining the `len` of `x`, the function checks whether `x` and `fx` have the same

    This class has been designed to store a list of `scipy.interpolate._Interpolator1D` objects, as

    Interpolating a function by pieces can be helpful if the function is surjective (ambiguous, one
    x value may map to different y values).

    possible outputs for a single input will be returned.

    It is assumed that the interpolations in the list raise a `ValueError` when an input value
    is outside their range, because `PiecewiseInterpolation` uses a `try`-`except` clause to
    check which of the pieces gives a valid result.
