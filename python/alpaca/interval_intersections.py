def intersection_of_two_intervals(interval_1, interval_2):
    r"""Find the intersection of two intervals

    Given two intervals :math:`\left[ a, b \right]` and :math:`\left[ c, d \right]`, this
    function finds their intersection.

    When searching for the intersection, all comparisons are made with the :math:`\leq` and
    :math:`\geq` operators.
    This means that if both arrays only have a single real number in common, i.e.
    :math:`\left[ a, b \right]` and :math:`\left[ b, d \right]`, the returned intersection will
    be :math:`\left[ b, b \right]`, and not an empty list.

    The intervals are sorted before they are processed by this function, so the interval limits can
    be unsorted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interval_1: list or ndarray of two float
        First interval. May be unsorted.
    interval_2: list or ndarray of two float
        Second interval. May be unsorted.

    Returns
    -------
    list of two float or empty list
        Intersection of the two intervals as a new interval, or an empty list.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> intersection_of_two_intervals([0.0, 1.0], [0.5, 1.5])
    [0.5, 1.0]
    >>> intersection_of_two_intervals([0.0, 1.0], [0.5, 0.6])
    [0.5, 0.6]
    >>> intersection_of_two_intervals([0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.5])
    [1.0, 1.0]
    >>> intersection_of_two_intervals([0.0, 1.0], [1.5, 2.0])

    Parameters
    ----------

        First interval. May be unsorted.
    list_of_intervals: list of lists or ndarrays of two float
        List of intervals. The single intervals may be unsorted.

    Returns
    -------
    list of lists of two float, or empty list
        Intersection of the interval with the list of intervals as a new list of intervals, or an empty list.
