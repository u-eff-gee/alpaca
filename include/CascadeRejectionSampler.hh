/**
 * \brief Sample directions of emission from an arbitrarily long cascade of angular correlations.
 * 
 * This class can be used to sample a cascade of gamma rays in which the direction of emission of
 * a gamma ray depends on the direction of emission of the previous gamma ray.
 * 
 * It makes use of the fact that an arbitrarily long cascade can be built from two-step 
 * dir-dir or pol-dir correlations, as they are implemented in the alpaca code (the simulation of 
 * pol-dir cascades is limited, see below).
 * The most obvious statement that this is possible can probably be found in the introduction of a
 * review article by Krane, Steffen, and Wheeler \cite KraneSteffenWheeler1973.
 * The authors base their formalism on the notion of an "oriented state", which is an excited state
 * whose magnetic substates are populated unequally.
 * The three possibilities of creating an oriented state listed by the authors include the 
 * "observation of preceding radiation" along a given axis \f$\vec{\mathbf{k}}_0\f$.
 * In a multi-step cascade, this is exactly what happens: a gamma ray from a previous emission
 * defines the reference frame \f$\vec{\mathbf{k}}_0\f$ for the subsequent two-step process.
 * 
 * Since the sampling of random vectors from two-step cascades can be handled by 
 * AngCorrRejectionSampler, the task of the present class is to rotate the directional vectors
 * from AngCorrRejectionSampler, which are defined with respect to the \f$z\f$ axis, into the 
 * reference frame given by the direction of emission sampled for the previous step.
 * For the rotations, Euler angles in the x convention (see also the EulerAngleRotation class) are
 * used.
 * 
 * In order to set up a cascade between \f$n > 3\f$ states with \f$n-1\f$ transitions
 * 
 * \f[
 *      j_1 \left( {L_1} \atop {L_1^\prime} \right) j_2 \left( {L_2} \atop {L_2^\prime} \right) j_3 ... j_{n-1} \left( {L_{n-1}} \atop {L_{n-1}^\prime} \right) j_n,
 * \f]
 * 
 * a std::vector of \f$n-2\f$ AngularCorrelation objects is passed to the 
 * constructor of CascadeRejectionSampler, with the first element denoting the first two 
 * transitions, 
 * 
 * \f[
 *      j_1 \left( {L_1} \atop {L_1^\prime} \right) j_2 \left( {L_2} \atop {L_2^\prime} \right) j_3,
 * \f]
 * 
 * the second element describing the second and third transition, 
 * 
 * \f[
 *      j_2 \left( {L_2} \atop {L_2^\prime} \right) j_3 \left( {L_3} \atop {L_3^\prime} \right) j_4,
 * \f]
 * 
 * and so on.
 * Note that the transition from the initial state to the intermediate state of the two-step 
 * correlation \f$m\f$ is the same as the transition from the intermediate state to the final state
 * for the two-step correlation \f$m-1\f$ for all intermediate steps \f$1 < m < n\f$.
 * This means that \f$n-3\f$ transitions appear twice in the AngularCorrelation objects.
 * 
 * The first angular correlation is special in the sense that a reference frame must be defined.
 * There are two possibilities:
 *  
 *  1. The cascade originates from an unoriented source. In that case, the first gamma ray is 
 * emitted in a direction sampled from a uniform random distribution on the surface of a sphere.
 *  2. The first gamma ray represents one of the mechanisms described by Krane, Steffen, and 
 * Wheeler \cite KraneSteffenWheeler1973 that orients the second state. For example, in a nuclear 
 * resonance fluorescence experiment, the first transition could correspond to the capture of a 
 * beam photon.
 * 
 * In the first case, it is usually desirable to return the direction of the first gamma ray, 
 * since it belongs to the cascade.
 * In the second case, the user can decide whether the first gamma ray should be included in the 
 * output.
 * 
 * Please note that the alpaca code implements dir-dir and pol-dir correlations, but no 
 * pol-pol correlations, which would be required to simulate the evolution of the gamma-ray 
 * polarization as the cascade progresses.
 * Consequently, only a single polarization measurement (i.e. a single instance of an 
 * AngularCorrelation with fully specified electromagnetic transitions) should be included in the
 * cascade to avoid unphysical results. 
 * Again, in the example of a nuclear resonance fluorescence experiment, this could be a polarized
 * photon beam that excites a nucleus, leading to a cascade of the type
 * 
 * \f[
 *      j_1 \left( {\vec{L_1}} \atop {L_1^\prime} \right) j_2 \left( {L_2} \atop {L_2^\prime} \right) j_3 ... j_{n-1} \left( {L_{n-1}} \atop {L_{n-1}^\prime} \right) j_n.
 * \f]
 * 
 * Since only the orientation of the polarization plane of the first transition can be controlled 
 * by the user (only in case 2, where the second state is oriented) by passing a set of Euler 
 * angles to the constructor of CascadeRejectionSampler, all other transitions can be treated 
 * as if they were rotationally symmetric around the \f$z\f$ axis.
 * This means that if the single polarized transition that may show up in the cascade is not the 
 * second transition, the polarization plane can simply be sampled from a uniform random 
 * distribution because there is nothing known about its orientation.
 * This implies that the relation between a vector \f$\left( \theta, \varphi \right)\f$ in 
 * spherical coordinates and a set of Euler angles \f$\left( \Phi, \Theta, \Psi \right)\f$ which, 
 * applied to the Cartesian vector \f$\left( 0, 0, 1 \right)\f$ (i.e the \f$z\f$ axis), generates 
 * this vector, is unique:
 * The first Euler rotation around the \f$z\f$ axis by the angle \f$\Phi\f$ has no effect on a 
 * rotationally symmetric body, therefore it can be neglected.
 * Internally, it is set to zero.
 * The orientation of the angular-correlation pattern along the last emitted gamma ray can be 
 * achieved using the Euler angles \f$\Theta\f$ and \f$\Psi\f$ only.
 * 
 * The CascadeRejectionSampler class uses a single random-number seed and a single maximum number 
 * of iterations for all of its random-number sampling members (\f$n-2\f$ instances of 
 * AngCorrRejectionSampler, and a single instance of SphereRejectionSampler).

     * \brief Constructor for a cascade in which the second second state is oriented.
     * 
     * This constructor assumes that the cascade starts with the second transition from an 
     * oriented second state.
     * The first transition is assumed to model some reaction mechanism that produces the 
     * orientation of the second state (for example the capture of a beam photon in nuclear 
     * resonance fluorescence).
     * When initialized like this, the output of CascadeRejectionSampler will not automatically 
     * include the direction of the first gamma ray, except if the return_first_direction option is
     * scattered.
     * This is helpful, for example, when simulating only the emitted radiation after the 
     * capture of a particle that produces an oriented excited state.
     * 
     * By default (all Euler angles set to zero), the reaction produces an orientation along the 
     * \f$z\f$ axis, with the polarization along the \f$x\f$ axis (if a polarized angular 
     * correlation is given as the first element of the cascade), because this is the default 
     * orientation of angular correlations in the alpaca code.
     * By providing a set of Euler angles, the orientation can be rotated into an arbitrary
     * reference frame.
     * For example, by using the first Euler angle \f$\Phi\f$, which denotes a rotation around the
     * z axis, the polarization plane can be rotated.
     * 
     * \param cascade List of angular correlations (AngularCorrelation objects) involved in the cascade. The first angular correlation is assumed to describe the first two transitions, the second angular correlation describes the second and the third transition, and so on.
     * \param seed Random number seed. Will be used for all internal random number samplers.
     * \param PhiThetaPsi Euler angles to control the orientation of the first gamma ray. Use {0, 0, 0} for the default orientation along the \f$z\f$ axis.
     * \param return_first_direction Determines whether the first gamma ray emitted in the transition from \f$j_1\f$ to \f$j_2\f$ should be included in the output (default: false, i.e. do not include the first gamma ray).
