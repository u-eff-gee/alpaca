/**
 * \brief Class for a polarization coefficient
 * 
 * The coefficients \f$\kappa_\nu\f$ are introduced in Eq. (I-4) of Ref. \cite FaggHanna1959
 * to take into account polarization information, which is probably why they are called 
 * polarization coefficients in \cite Kneissl1996.
 * They are defined as {Eq. (I-7) in \cite FaggHanna1959}:
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \kappa_\nu \left( L, L^\prime \right) = - \sqrt{ \frac{ \left( \nu - 2 \right)! }{ \left( \nu + 2 \right)! } } 
 * \frac{ 
 *      \left(
 *		    \begin{array}{ccc}
 *			    L & L^\prime & \nu \\
 *			    1 & 1 & 2
 *		    \end{array}
 *	    \right)
 * }{
 *      \left(
 *		    \begin{array}{ccc}
 *			    L & L^\prime & \nu \\
 *			    1 & -1 & 0
 *		    \end{array}
 *	    \right).
 * }
 * \f]
 * 
 * The definition includes two Clebsch Gordan (CG) coefficients.
 * For the CG coefficient in the denominator, divisions by zero are anticipated if the triangle
 * inequality {see, e.g., Eq. I.2.3.ii in \cite Messiah19622}
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \left| L - L^\prime \right| < \nu < L + L^\prime
 * \f]
 * 
 * is not fulfilled.
 * This is only a computational issue, since the ratio of all possible CG coefficients encountered 
 * in the present formalism can be shown to have no pole within the domain of possible \f$L\f$, 
 * \f$L^\prime\f$ and \f$\nu\f$ {see, e.g., Eq. (85a) in \cite AjzenbergSelove1960}:
 * The \f$\kappa_\nu\f$ always appear in as a factor in front of an \f$F_\nu\f$ 
 * coefficient in terms like {see, e.g., Eq. (I-9) in \cite FaggHanna1959}:
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \kappa_\nu \left( L L^\prime \right) F_\nu \left( L, L^\prime, ... \right).
 * \f]
 * 
 * The corresponding \f$F_\nu\f$ coefficient contains the same CG coefficient as in the denominator
 * of the \f$\kappa_\nu\f$ coefficient, which cancels the pole (see the FCoefficient class).
 * It also contains a Wigner-6j symbol which imposes the triangle inequality above again.
 * Despite this issue, the code uses the CG coefficients since they allow the coefficients 
 * \f$\kappa_\nu\f$ to be written in a compact form.
 * Due to the considerations above, divisions by zero are avoided by checking the triangle 
 * inequality and returning \f$\kappa_\nu = 0\f$ if it is violated.
 * 
 * One will also run into problems for \f$\nu = 0\f$, 
 * since two different angular momenta \f$L\f$ and \f$L^\prime\f$ can not be coupled to zero,
 * and the behavior of the factorial for negative numbers is undefined (The latter problem persists
 * for \f$\nu = 1\f$. However, this case is not encountered here).
 * Reference \cite FaggHanna1959 and Ref. \cite LLoyd1952, which is cited by the former for 
 * \f$\kappa_\nu\f$, only give values for the coefficients with \f$\nu > 2\f$ 
 * [see Tab. II(b) \cite FaggHanna1959 and Tab. III \cite LLoyd1952, respectively, and note 
 * the different normalization].
 * Equation (I-8) of Ref. \cite FaggHanna1959 mentions a restriction to
 * even, nonzero values of \f$\nu\f$ when the dir-dir correlation is extended to include 
 * polarization, but does not attribute this to the \f$\kappa_\nu\f$ coefficients.
 * In the present implementation, it was decided to throw an exception when \f$\kappa_{\nu < 2}\f$
 * is requested.
