 * \brief Sample directions in spherical coordinates from an angular correlation.

 * Compared to its base class, SphereRejectionSampler, this class provides a member variable to
 * store an AngularCorrelation object that acts as the probability distribution \f$W\f$.
 * Although SphereRejectionSampler already accepts an arbitrary function of \f$\theta\f$ and
 * \f$\varphi\f$, a function object of the class AngularCorrelation cannot be passed this way.
 * Therefore, the present class was derived.
 * For more information, see the base class.
