/**
 * \brief Class for sampling points approximately uniformly on the surface of a sphere
 * 
 * The actual problem of sampling a given number of \f$n\f$ points on the surface of a sphere
 * such that they are uniformly distributed ('Thomson problem' \cite Thomson1904) can only be 
 * solved using numerical optimization methods for arbitrary values of \f$n\f$ \cite Wales2006.
 * 
 * This implementation uses an approximation proposed by Koay2011 \cite Koay2011 that samples 
 * equidistant points on a spiral trajectory 
 * \f$\mathbf{x} \left[ \theta, \varphi \left( \theta \right) \right]\f$ with:
 * {Eq. (3) in \cite Koay2011}
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \varphi \left( \theta \right) = c \theta,
 * \f]
 * 
 * Here, \f$\mathbf{x}\f$ denotes a point in three-dimensional space on the surface of a unit 
 * sphere, which is characterized by the azimuthal (\f$\theta\f$) and polar (\f$\varphi\f$)
 * angles in spherical coordinates.
 * The parameter \f$c\f$ is a positive real number.
 * Note that it was renamed compared to \cite Koay2011 to avoid confusion with the argument of 
 * the elliptic integral that is part of the algorithm.
 * The trajectory, which is defined by the relation between \f$\theta\f$ and \f$\varphi\f$, runs 
 * from the pole of the sphere at \f$\left(0, 0, 1\right)\f$ to the one at \f$\left( 0, 0, -1 \right)\f$.

     * \brief Elliptic integral of the second kind \f$E\left( \varphi | m \right)\f$ for arbitrary real parameters
     * 
     * The length of the spiral trajectory, \f$S\left( \Theta \right)\f$, on which points are 
     * sampled in Ref. \cite Koay2011 [Eq. (4) therein]
     * can be expressed by incomplete elliptic integrals of the second kind \f$E\left( \varphi | m \right)\f$ {Eq. (5) in Ref. \cite Koay2011}:
     * 
     * \f[
     *      E\left( \varphi | m \right) = \int_0^{\varphi} \sqrt{ 1 - m \left[ \sin \left( \theta \right) \right]^2 } \mathrm{d} \theta.
     * \f]
     * 
     * where \f$\varphi\f$ is an angle, and \f$m\f$ is assumed to be a negative real number 
     * [\f$m = -c^2\f$, see Eq. (4)] in Ref. \cite Koay2011.
     * A definition of the elliptic integrals can be found in Sec. 17 of the 'Handbook of
     * Mathematical Functions' by Abramowitz and Stegun \cite AbramowitzStegun1974.
     * It indicates that \f$m\f$ may even be complex [see, e.g. the discussion below Eq. (17.2.18) therein].
     * The functions \f$E\left( \varphi | \theta \right)\f$ are implemented in the GNU Scientific 
     * Library (GSL) \cite Galassi2009 only for \f$ 0 \leq m < 1 \f$ with a parameter \f$k\f$,
     * 
     * \f[
     *      k^2 = m.
     * \f]
     * 
     * However, for any real parameter \f$m\f$ that is negative or has an absolute value larger 
     * than 1, the evaluation of the integral can be traced back to an evaluation in the interval 
     * \f$ 0 \leq m < 1 \f$ according to Eqs. (17.4.16) and (17.4.18) in 
     * \cite AbramowitzStegun1974.
     * These transformations assume a formulation of the incomplete elliptic integral in terms
     * of the parameter \f$u\f$ instead of \f$\varphi\f$, i.e. \f$E \left( u | m \right)\f$.
     * The quantity \f$u\f$ is the generalized angle \f$\varphi\f$ for the case of an ellipse
     * , such that, for example, an elliptic equivalent \f$\mathrm{sn}\f$ {a 'Jacobi Elliptic 
     * Function', see, e.g., Sec. 16 in Ref. \cite abromowitzStegun1974} of the trigonometric 
     * function \f$\sin\f$ can be defined {Eq. (17.2.2) in Ref. \cite AbramowitzStegun1974}:
     * 
     * \f[
     *      \mathrm{sn} \left( u \right) = \sin \left( \varphi \right).
     * \f]
     * 
     * The equation above provides a straightforward conversion from the Jacobi elliptic function 
     * \f$\mathrm{sn} \left( u \right)\f$ to \f$\varphi\f$ via the inverse sine.
     * The Jacobi elliptic functions are also implemented in GSL for the argument \f$u\f$,
     * but it should be noted that this implementation utilizes the parameter \f$m\f$ 
     * instead of \f$k\f$.
     * The conversion from \f$\varphi\f$ to \f$u\f$ is possible via the definition of the 
     * incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind {Eq. (17.2.7) in Ref. \cite AbramowitzStegun1974}:
     * 
     * \f[
     *      F \left( \varphi | m \right) = u.
     * \f]
     * 
     * For an arbitrary \f$m\f$, the function 
     * SpherePointSampler::elliptic_integral_2nd_kind_arbitrary_m will be called recursively 
     * with transformed parameters until the parameter can be handled by the GSL implementation.
     * 
     * In fact, the implementation does not only use the formalism of Abramowitz and Stegun, but 
     * the transformation to the interval \f$ 0 \leq m < 1 \f$ of the incomplete elliptic 
     * integral of the second kind is performed using 
     * Eq. (19.7.5) ('Imaginary Modulus Transformation') of the NIST Digital Library of 
     * Mathematical Functions (DLMF) \cite DLMF2020.
     * This equation has the advantage that it does not require the back-and-forth conversion 
     * between \f$\varphi\f$ and \f$u\f$, and that it handles \f$m < 0\f$ and \f$|m| > 1\f$
