/**
 * \brief Simple integration of a function of 2 variables on a sphere surface
 *
 * The aim of this class is to calculate an integral of the type
 *
 * \f[
 *      \int_{\Delta \Omega} f\left( \theta, \varphi \right) \mathrm{d} \Omega
 * \f]
 *
 * for a function \f$f(\theta, \varphi)\f$ of the polar (\f$\theta\f$) and
 * aimuthal
 * (\f$\varphi\f$) angles in spherical coordinates.
 * The integration is over a domain \f$\Delta \Omega\f$ on the surface of a
 * sphere.
 *
 * A simple brute force method is used to perform the integration numerically.
 * It samples \f$n\f$ uniformly distributed points \f$\left( \theta_i, \varphi_i
 * \right)\f$ , \f$i \in \left[ 0, n-1 \right]\f$ on the surface of the sphere.
 * The values \f$f\left( theta_i, \varphi_i \right)\f$ are then calculated and
 * assumed to represent the value of the function on the entire solid-angle
 * element of the size
 *
 * \f[
 *      \delta \Omega_i \equiv \delta \Omega = \frac{4 \pi}{n}
 * \f]
 *
 * which is covered by each point.
 * This can be seen as a crude implementation of the Riemann integral in two
 * dimensions. Consequently, the integral is approximated by a sum:
 *
 * \f[
 *      \int_{\Delta \Omega} f\left( \theta, \varphi \right) \mathrm{d} \Omega
 *      \approx \delta \Omega \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} f \left( \theta_i, \varphi_i
 * \right). \f]
 *
 * Note that the uniform sampling of points on the surface of a sphere is not
 * trivial. The present implementation uses an approximate method that is
 * implemented in the SpherePointSampler class.
 *
 * Note also that the present integration method does not require the weighting
 * factor \f$\sin\left( \theta \right)\f$ which must be used in spherical
 * coordinates.
