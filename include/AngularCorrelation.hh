/**
 * \brief Class for a gamma-gamma correlation.
 * 
 * Calculates the angular correlation \f$W_{\gamma \gamma} \left( \theta, \varphi \right)\f$ 
 * between the first and the last photon in a sequence of \f$n-1\f$ (\f$n > 2\f$) 
 * electromagnetic (EM) transitions between \f$n\f$ states of a quantized system 
 * (a 'cascade' of EM transitions with \f$n-1\f$ steps).
 * The angles \f$\theta \in \left[ 0, \pi \right]\f$ and 
 * \f$\varphi \in \left[ 0, 2 \pi \right]\f$ are the polar and azimuthal angles in a spherical
 * coordinate system, respectively.
 * States of the system are identified by their total angular momentum quantum numbers
 * \f$J\f$ (\f$2J \in \mathcal{N} \f$, \f$J \geq 0\f$) and their parities 
 * \f$\pi \in \lbrace -1, 1 \rbrace \f$.
 * They are labeled by indices \f$0 < i \geq n\f$, where \f$i = 1\f$ denotes the first, and
 * \f$i = n\f$ the last state of a cascade.
 * EM transitions are identified by their multipolarity \f$L\f$ (\f$L \in \mathcal{N} \f$, \f$L \geq 0\f$) and their EM character 
 * \f$\lambda \in \lbrace \mathrm{E}, \mathrm{M} \rbrace\f$ which can be either electric (E) or 
 * magnetic (M).
 * They are labeled by indices \f$1 \geq i < n\f$, where the \f$i\f$-th transition is assumed to be
 * the transition that connects the states labeled \f$i\f$ and \f$i+1\f$.
 * A transition between two states may be a mixture of up to two multipolarities \f$L_i\f$ and 
 * \f$L_i^\prime\f$, whose relative contributions are quantified by the corresponding 
 * multipole mixing ratio \f$\delta_i\f$ 
 * (see below about the convention for \f$\delta\f$ which is used in the present implementation).
 * 
 * The minimum possible cascade with \f$n = 3\f$ states is denoted symbolically as:
 * 
 * \f[
 *      J_1^{\pi_1} 
 *      \left( \begin{array}{ccc} L_1 \\ L_1^\prime \end{array} \right)
 *      J_2^{\pi_2}
 *      \left( \begin{array}{ccc} L_2 \\ L_2^\prime \end{array} \right)
 *      J_3^{\pi_3}.
 * \f]
 * 
 * A cascade between \f$n > 3\f$ states is denoted as:
 * 
 * \f[
 *      J_1^{\pi_1} 
 *      \left( \begin{array}{ccc} L_1 \\ L_1^\prime \end{array} \right)
 *      J_2^{\pi_2}
 *      \left( \begin{array}{ccc} L_2 \\ L_2^\prime \end{array} \right)
 *      ...
 *      J_{n-1}^{\pi_{n-1}}
 *      \left( \begin{array}{ccc} L_{n-1} \\ L_{n-1}^\prime \end{array} \right)
 *      J_n^{\pi_n}.
 * \f]
 * 
 * The transitions with \f$ 1 < i < n-1\f$ are assumed to be unobserved.
 * The photon which corresponds to the first (see below about the notion of 'first' and 'second') 
 * transition is assumed to be observed along the positive z direction (\f$\theta = 0\f$).
 * It may also be interpreted as a beam of photons which travels in that direction and causes 
 * the excitation of the state \f$J_2^{\pi_2}\f$ from the initial state \f$J_1^{\pi_1}\f$.
 * Apart from a correlation between the directions of motion of the two photons 
 * [direction-direction (dir-dir) correlation], the present implementation can take into 
 * account that the polarization of the first photon is observed in addition [a 
 * polarization-direction (pol-dir) correlation].
 * Here, it is assumed that the polarization is along the x axis 
 * (\f$\theta = \pi/2\f$, \f$\varphi = 0\f$ denotes the positive x axis).
 * Only the observation of polarization information, which introduces a dependence of the 
 * angular correlation on the azimuthal angle \f$\varphi\f$, allows for a distinction between 
 * different EM characters, which are also related to the parities of the corresponding states.
 * For this reason, the code will assume a pol-dir correlation if parities and EM 
 * characters associated with the first (the 'first' transition is well-defined in the user interface of the 
 * code) transition are given, and a dir-dir correlation otherwise.
 * 
 * The formalism of angular correlations which was used in the present implementation is mainly 
 * based on a review article by Fagg and Hanna 
 * \cite FaggHanna1959 and on a book chapter by Biedenharn \cite AjzenbergSelove1960.
 * Consequently, Biedenharn's convention for the multipole mixing ratio is used.
 * For a comparison to the other popular conventions of Rose and Brink and Krane, Steffen, and 
 * Wheeler, see Refs. \cite RoseBrink1967 and \cite KraneSteffenWheeler1973, respectively.
 * When a two-step cascade is considered in which the first and the last state are identical,
 * Biedenharn's convention has the advantage that \f$\delta_1 = \delta_2\f$.
 * 
 * In the angular correlation formalism, the expansion coefficients of \f$W_{\gamma \gamma}\f$
 * in terms of Legendre polynomials are separable into contributions by the different transitions.
 * Therefore, a 'first' and 'last' transition of the cascade actually need not be identified.
 * In other words, it does not matter whether the photon observed in z direction with an 
 * polarization in x direction is the first or the last one of the cascade.
 * However, the unobserved transitions must take place in between the two, otherwise they would 
 * not have to be considered anyway.
 * 
 * In order to describe an observation of the 'first' photon in an arbitrary direction with an 
 * arbitrary orientation of the polarization in the plane perpendicular to the direction of
 * propagation, the code allows to rotate the angular correlation by three Euler angles 
 * \f$\Phi\f$, \f$\Theta\f$, and \f$\Psi\f$.
 * They are defined to be the rotation angles around the z-, x', and z' axes, respectively, as 
 * described, for example, in Ref. \cite Weisstein2020.
 * 
 * Like many other quantum mechanical computer codes, this one also uses \f$2 J\f$ instead of 
 * \f$J\f$ and \f$2L\f$ instead of \f$L\f$ to be able to represent both integer and half-integer 
 * angular momentum quantum numbers internally as integers.
 * 
 * The angular correlation is normalized to \f$4\pi\f$, i.e.:
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi W_{\gamma \gamma} \left( \theta, \varphi \right) \sin \left( \theta \right) \mathrm{d} \theta \mathrm{d} \varphi = 4 \pi
 * \f]

    /**
     * \brief Constructor
     * 
     * An EM cascade is specified entirely by the arguments of the constructor.
     * The first argument is the initial state of the cascade, which is sometimes denoted as the
     * 'oriented' state in the literature, because its decay/excitation defines the coordinate 
     * system.
     * All other cascade steps are given as a list of pairs of transitions and the states
     * which they populate.
     * The transition between the initial state and the second state, and the one between the
     * \f$n-1\f$-th and the \f$n\f$-th state, are assumed to be the two observed transitions.
     * All other transitions are treated as unobserved.
     * 
     * If the parities of the initial state and the second state, and both EM characters of the
     * first transition are given, the code will assume a pol-dir correlation.
     * If none of these data is given, the code will assume a dir-dir correlation.
     * 
     * The constructor checks the input data for consistency in terms of angular momentum coupling
     * and selection rules for EM transitions.
     * Further checks are performed by the constructors of the State and Transition classes.
     * 
     * \param ini_sta Initial state of the cascade.
     * \param cas_ste Cascade steps, given as a list of arbitrary length which contains 
     * Transition-State pairs. 
     * The first and the last transition of this list are assumed to be observed.
     * 
     * \throw invalid_argument if at least one of the following consistency checks fails: 
     * 1. The number of cascade steps is larger than one, because two transitions are needed 
     * for a gamma-gamma correlation.
     * 2. At least one multipolarity of a transition fulfils the triangle inequality with the 
     * angular momenta of the initial and final states of that transition.
     * 3. The EM characters of all multipolarities of a single transition fulfil
     * the parity selection rules.
     * In particular, if at least one parity or EM character is specified, all others must also
     * be specified for the given transition and the states which it links.
     * Note that this also applies to so-called 'pure' transitions where only a single 
     * multipolarity is allowed.

     * Simplified version of the general constructor which takes a vector of State objects
     * as cascade steps.
     * See the general constructor for more information.
     * 
     * For the multipolarities, electromagnetic characters, and mixing ratios of the transitions,
     * the most likely values will be inferred according to the following rules: 
     * 
     * \enum The multipolarities are assumed to be the lowest possible ones permitted by the triangle inequality for each transitions.
     * \enum The EM character for the transition between the initial state and the second state is set to 'unknown' if any of the parities of the two states is unknown. In this case, a dir-dir correlation will be calculated. If both parities are known, the EM characters corresponding to the lowest possible multipole orders will be chosen. The EM characters for all other transitions are assumed in the same way(Note that the pol-dir correlation only depends on the EM character of the transition for which the polarization information is available.).
     * \enum All multipole-mixing ratios are assumed to be zero.
     * 
     * All the aforementioned rules are based on the single-particle 'Weisskopf' estimates 
     * (see, e.g., Sec. 6.A in Ref. \cite BlattWeisskopf1979), which favor the lowest multipole
     * order.
     *

     * last state of this list are assumed to be observed.

     * two transitions are needed for a gamma-gamma correlation.
