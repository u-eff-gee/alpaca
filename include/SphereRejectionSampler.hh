/**
 * \brief Sample from a probability distribution in spherical coordinates using rejection sampling.
 * 
 * Given a probability distribution 
 * 
 * \f[
 * W\left( \Omega \right) \mathrm{d}\Omega = W \left( \theta, \varphi\right) \sin \left( \theta \right) \mathrm{d} \theta \mathrm{d} \varphi,
 * \f]
 * 
 * which determines the probability of finding a vector in the solid angle element 
 * \f$\mathrm{d}\Omega\f$ (expressed as 
 * \f$\sin \left( \theta \right) \mathrm{d} \theta \mathrm{d} \varphi\f$ in spherical coordinates, 
 * with the polar angle \f$\theta\f$ and the aximuthal angle \f$\varphi\f$)
 * this class samples random pairs \f$\left( \theta, \varphi \right)\f$ distributed according to \f$W\f$.
 * 
 * The sampling algorithm used here is 'rejection sampling' (see, e.g. Sec. 2.3 in Ref.
 * \cite RobertCasella1999).
 * It requires an upper limit \f$W_\mathrm{max}\f$ for the maximum value of the distribution:
 * 
 * \f[
 *      W_\mathrm{max} \geq \mathrm{max}_{\theta \in \left[ 0, \pi \right], \varphi \in \left[ 0, 2\pi \right]} W \left( \theta, \varphi \right).
 * \f]
 * 
 * It starts by sampling a point \f$\left( \theta_\mathrm{rand}, \varphi_\mathrm{rand} \right)\f$ 
 * from a uniform distribution on a sphere surface (see, e.g. Ref. \cite Weisstein20202):
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \theta_\mathrm{rand} = \mathrm{arccos} \left( 2u - 1 \right)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *      \varphi_\mathrm{rand} = 2 v \pi.
 * \f]
 * 
 * Here, \f$u\f$ and \f$v\f$ denote independent uniform random numbers in the range \f$\left[ 0, 1 \right]\f$.
 * After that, a uniform random number \f$W_\mathrm{rand}\f$ in the range 
 * \f$\left[ 0, W_\mathrm{max} \right]\f$ is sampled.
 * If
 * 
 * \f[
 *      W_\mathrm{rand} \leq W \left( \theta_\mathrm{rand}, \varphi_\mathrm{rand} \right),
 * \f]
 * 
 * then the vector \f$\left( \theta_\mathrm{rand}, \varphi_\mathrm{rand} \right)\f$ is accepted.
 * If not, the vector is rejected and the algorithm start from the beginning by sampling a new 
 * point on the sphere surface.
 * Note that the last inequality ensures that the probability of sampling a vector 
 * \f$\left( \theta, \varphi \right)\f$ is proportional to \f$W \left( \theta, \varphi \right)\f$.
 * This algorithm obviously works best if the probability of a vector being rejected is small, 
 * i.e. if \f$W_\mathrm{max}\f$ is a good approximation of the real maximum of \f$W\f$, and if the
 * distribution is not too different from a uniform distribution 
 * \f$W = \left( 4 \pi \right)^{-1}\f$.
 * Note that rejection sampling does not require the distribution to be normalized.
 * 
 * In principle, rejection sampling proceeds in an infinite loop until a valid vector has been 
 * found.
 * Here, the loop is limited to a maximum number of trial vectors \f$N_\mathrm{max}\f$.
 * If this maximum number is reached, the point \f$\left( 0, 0 \right)\f$ is returned.
 * 
 * As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithm for a given distribution, define the efficiency
 * 
 * \f[
 *      \epsilon = \frac{1}{\langle N \rangle},
 * \f]
 * 
 * which is the inverse of the average number of trial vectors \f$\langle N \rangle\f$ that have 
 * to be sampled before a vector is accepted.
