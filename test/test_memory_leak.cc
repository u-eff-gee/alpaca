/**
 * This code can be used to test for memory leaks of alpaca.
 * A common use case of alpaca is the repeated construction and deletion of AngularCorrelation 
 * objects, which is particularly important for the python interface.
 * 
 * The ang_corr object created in the function above should be destroyed completely when it goes 
 * out of scope at the end of the function call, i.e. after some short initialization, this program
 * should not allocate additional memory any more.
 * 
 * By profiling this test with valgrind, the author was able to find a memory leak in 
 * AngularCorrelation.
 * It was decided to simply keep the script as an additional test.
